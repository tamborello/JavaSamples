Revision History

Revision 1  2015.11.05
Inception


Revision 2  2015.11.05
Progress save for more interface elements added, tutorial page 5.


Revision 3  2015.11.05
Progress save for more interface elements added, tutorial page 8.


Revision 4  2015.11.07
Android compilation requires a top-level domain name, such as "com," be prepended to the project class name.
Bug: Does not compile and launch, throwing a java fxml load exception.

Revision 5  2015.11.10
Traced r4's compilation failure to a load exception failure due bad reference to class ScenebuilderExample in line 12 of ScenebuilderExample.fxml: the "com" name prefix was missing.
Project now compiles and launches the GUI application. 
Bugs: What I see in the Scenebuilder tool is not what I get in the application!
Missing elements: "Issue Tracking Lite" logo
Otherwise, everything appears as expected.

Revision 6  2015.11.11
Bug squashed: missing "Issue Tracking Lite" logo image. It turns out Scenebuilder needed that png to be in the same directory as the fxml file,
http://blog.professional-webworkx.de/javafx-create-fxml-in-scene-builder-and-add-image-to-imageview/
â€¦but page 8 of Oracle's Scenebuilder tutorial didn't mention that!
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/scene-builder-2/get-started-tutorial/add-toolbar.htm

Note: When the application first draws the window, all the elements appear oversized. Then when I drag the application window to another display, everything gets redrawn to the smaller size I expect, and everything appears fine.
